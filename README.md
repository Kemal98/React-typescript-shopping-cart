# React-typescript-shopping-cart

This is a description of a project I developed using React, TypeScript and Bootstrap 
- a fully functional shopping cart. This project was created in React and TypeScript.

In the project I use Bootstrap to create a responsive and attractive user interface. 
Also, to manage global state I use the useContext API. This allows components 
to communicate without having to pass props through several levels.

The functionality of the shopping cart includes adding products to the cart, 
displaying the total amount, increasing and decreasing the amount of products in the cart, 
deleting products from the cart. All of this is implemented using React Hooks and TypeScript.
